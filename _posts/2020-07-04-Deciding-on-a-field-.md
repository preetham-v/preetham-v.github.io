An assumption that is often made is that you should only apply to grad school once you are certain of a highly specific topic that you are willing to commit a lifetime to studying. However, students are only expected to commit to a thesis topic after one or two years in a Ph.D. program, and the time before that is usually meant to explore new areas of research through rotations, coursework and exploratory projects. In addition, you'd often need to work closely with an advisor to propose a topic, as external factors like funding and new publications may influence the field you eventually settle on. Lastly, it is not uncommon to change your research area after a Ph.D. [[1]](#1), that is if you decide to stay in academia at all. The key takeaway is that you do not need to have a clear, thought out thesis topic in order to apply to grad school.

It may, however, be helpful to have a broad idea of what interests you, and what you can imagine yourself enjoying doing.
