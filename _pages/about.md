I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am pursuing a chemistry major as part of the Bachelor of Science (Research) program, and my thesis project uses molecular dynamics to study prion proteins. <br> <br>

My academic interests revolve around biophysics, protein design and medicinal chemistry. <br> <br>

I am also a big fan of Chelsea Football Club and may occasionally be found at a local screening appearing very agitated. <br> <br>
