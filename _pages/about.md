![My Photo](/images/potrait.jpg)
I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am pursuing a chemistry major as part of the Bachelor of Science (Research) program, and my thesis project uses molecular dynamics to study prion proteins.

My academic interests revolve around biophysics, protein design and medicinal chemistry.

I am also a big fan of Chelsea Football Club and may occasionally be found at a local screening appearing very agitated.
