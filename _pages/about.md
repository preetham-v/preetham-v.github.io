I am a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science (Research) degree, with a major in chemistry and a minor in biology. My thesis project uses molecular dynamics to study structural features of prion dimers and mutants.

My academic interests revolve around biophysics, protein design and medicinal chemistry.

I am also a big fan of Chelsea Football Club and may occasionally be found at a local screening, appearing very agitated.
