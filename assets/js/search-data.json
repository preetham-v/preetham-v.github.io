            "content": "An assumption that is often made is that you should only apply to grad school once you are certain of a highly specific topic that you are willing to commit a lifetime to studying. However, students are only expected to commit to a thesis topic after one or two years in a Ph.D. program, and the time before that is usually meant to explore new areas of research through rotations, coursework and exploratory projects. In addition, you&#39;d often need to work closely with an advisor to propose a topic, as external factors like funding and new publications may influence the field you eventually settle on. Lastly, it is not uncommon to change your research area after a Ph.D. [[1]](#1), that is if you decide to stay in academia at all. The key takeaway is that you do not need to have a clear, thought out thesis topic in order to apply to grad school. . It may, however, be helpful to have a broad idea of what interests you, and what you can imagine yourself enjoying doing. ##References [1] https://www.sciencemag.org/features/2015/08/transitioning-fields-between-phd-and-postdoc .",
